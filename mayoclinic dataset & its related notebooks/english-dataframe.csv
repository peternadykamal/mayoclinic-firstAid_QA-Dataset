How do you perform mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing during CPR?,"After opening the airway (using the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver), pinch the nostrils shut for mouth-to-mouth breathing and cover the person's mouth with yours, making a seal. Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Give the first rescue breath — lasting one second — and watch to see if the chest rises. If the chest rises, give a second breath. If the chest doesn't rise, repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver and then give a second breath. Thirty chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths is considered one cycle. Be careful not to provide too many breaths or to breathe with too much force.",cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)
What should you do after giving rescue breaths during CPR?,Resume chest compressions to restore blood flow.,cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)

When should you start rescue breathing when giving CPR to a child?,"If you have been trained in CPR, open the airway and start rescue breathing after performing chest compressions.",cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)
What are the steps for mouth-to-mouth breathing for a child during CPR?,"After using the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver to open the airway, pinch the child's nostrils shut. Cover the child's mouth with yours, making a seal. Breathe into the child's mouth for one second and watch to see if the chest rises. If it rises, give a second breath. If the chest doesn't rise, repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver first, and then give the second breath. Be careful not to provide too many breaths or to breathe with too much force. After the two breaths, immediately begin the next cycle of compressions and breaths. Note: If there are two people available to do CPR on the child, change rescuers every two minutes — or sooner if the rescuer is fatigued — and give one to two breaths every 15 compressions.",cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)
What should you do as soon as an AED becomes available during CPR for a child?,"As soon as an AED is available, apply it and follow the prompts. Use pediatric pads for children older than 4 weeks old and up to age 8. If pediatric pads aren't available, use adult pads. Give one shock, then restart CPR — starting with chest compressions — for two more minutes before giving a second shock. If you're not trained to use an AED, a 911 operator or another emergency medical operator may be able to give you directions.",cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)
How should you perform CPR on a baby 4 weeks old or older?,"First, evaluate the situation. Touch the baby and watch for a response, such as movement. Don't shake the baby.

Imagine a horizontal line drawn between the baby's nipples. Place two fingers of one hand just below this line, in the center of the chest. Gently compress the chest about 1.5 inches (about 4 centimeters). Count aloud as you push in a fairly rapid rhythm. You should push at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute, just as you would when giving an adult CPR.",cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)
How do you open the airway during CPR for a baby?,"After 30 compressions, gently tip the head back by lifting the chin with one hand and pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.",cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)
What is the process for breathing during CPR for a baby?,"Cover the baby's mouth and nose with your mouth. Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Use the strength of your cheeks to deliver gentle puffs of air (instead of deep breaths from your lungs) to slowly breathe into the baby's mouth one time, taking one second for the breath. Watch to see if the baby's chest rises. If it does, give a second rescue breath. If the chest does not rise, repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver and then give the second breath. If the baby's chest still doesn't rise, continue chest compressions. Give two breaths after every 30 chest compressions. If two people are performing CPR, give one to two breaths after every 15 chest compressions. Continue CPR until you see signs of life or until medical personnel arrive.",cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)

What should you do to clear the airway of an unconscious person who is choking?,"Lower the person onto the floor, with the back on the floor and arms to the sides. Clear the airway. If you can see the object, reach a finger into the mouth to sweep out the object. Never finger sweep if you can't see the object. You risk pushing the blockage deeper into the airway. This is very risky with young children. Begin CPR if the person still doesn't respond. If the airway is still blocked, use chest compressions such as those that are used in CPR to remove the stuck object. Only use two rescue breaths per cycle. Recheck the mouth regularly for the object.",choking
